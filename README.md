# The-Random-Python-University
"The Random Python University" is an accurate and consistent simulation of a randomly generated university with a conditional and probabilistic approach during each execution of the program. Within the university, core processes of a university can be observed as being carried out and executed by the Simulated-Person-Characters (SPC).
